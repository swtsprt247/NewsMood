Twitter Analysis

3 Observable Trends based on the data:
1)  All of the sentiments were in the negatives for 2/2/2018, this could be due to breaking news relatied 
    to politics.
2)  BBC had the worse sentiments while CBS had the best sentiments, NYT had the best sentiments,
    this could be due to the fact that NYT is not a television news outlet.
3)  Based on the American News television sites, CNN had the worse sentiments and CBS had the best,
    again, this could be due to the fact that CBS is not a 24hr cable news site.
