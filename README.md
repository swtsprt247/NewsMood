# NewsMood
For this project, you'll create a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets, and to present your findings visually.


# Rationale
Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out per day. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.


# Rescources
[Tweepy](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/) was used in order to collect the tweets while [Vader Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) was used to capture the sentiments of each tweet.
